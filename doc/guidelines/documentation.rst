Module Documentation
====================

The main purpose of the module documentation is to describe what is **relevant for the users** of
the module. Additionally, also internal design aspects can be documented here.

The central tool for the documentation is `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_, which makes it
easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation. Sphinx uses
`reStructuredText  <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>`_ as its markup language, and many
of its strengths come from the power and straightforwardness of reStructuredText and its parsing
and translating suite, the `Docutils <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>`_.

If you are not familiar with reStructuredText, you may read the introduction page
on the Sphinx webpage first: `reStructuredText Primer
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_.
